What is WORD SHOT?
==================

WORD SHOT is a word game by Undrev. The game's objective is to type the words correctly by using a keyboard or a mouse. There are several game types (Word Typing, Word Translating [planned]) in a game, each one has different modes to play.

In "Challenge" mode you have only few seconds per word. In "Relax" mode there is no rush, but each next level requires more words to complete. Moreover, a complexity of the words increases from level to level. How far will you go?

WORD SHOT is available for Windows (32b/64b), Linux (64b) and Mac OSX (64b). There is also a Web version to play online.
